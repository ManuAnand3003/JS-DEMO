# Canvas Particles & Creatures Demo

This is a lightweight canvas demonstration showcasing a particle system and several interactive, procedurally animated creatures.

## Files

- `demo.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
- `demo.css`: All styles for the layout and controls.
- `demo.js`: The core logic, including the particle system, all entity classes (Snake, Dragon, etc.), and UI controls.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## How to Run

This project is best run with a local web server. If you are using VS Code, the "Live Server" extension is a great option.

1. Open the folder `c:\Users\MANU ANAND\OneDrive\Desktop\CODES\html` in VS Code.
2. If you don't have it, install the **Live Server** extension from the marketplace.
3. Right-click `demo.html` in the file explorer and choose "Open with Live Server".

## Interaction

The controls are located in the translucent sidebar on the left.

- **Entity Selector**: Use the dropdown menu to choose which creature to display on the canvas. Options include `Snake`, `Fish`, `Koi`, `Centipede`, and `Dragon`. Selecting `None` will show only the background particles.
- **Mouse Control**: The selected creature will follow your mouse cursor around the canvas.
- **Particle Spawning**: Clicking and holding the mouse button will spawn a stream of background particles from the cursor's position.
- **Count Slider**: Adjusts the number of particles spawned when you click and hold the mouse.
- **Speed Slider**: Controls the movement speed of both the active creature and all particles.
- **Clear Button**: Removes all particles from the canvas.

## Notes

- This project was consolidated from separate files into a single, cohesive demo.
- It is designed to work in all modern web browsers.
